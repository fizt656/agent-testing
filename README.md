# üìß AI-Powered Email Management Suite for Gmail

This project provides a suite of Python scripts to help manage your Gmail inbox using AI-powered analysis and automation. It leverages OpenAI's GPT models for tasks like identifying important emails, categorizing messages, and assisting with cleanup, while using the Gmail API for direct inbox interaction.

A new **unified command-line interface (`cli.py`)** is now available to provide a guided, Q&A style experience for accessing the suite's functionalities.

*   **Modular Utilities (`email_utils.py`):** Centralized functions for Gmail service authentication (now with improved scope handling), sending emails, and terminal colorization.
*   **Configuration:** Uses a `.env` file for API keys and has script-specific configurations for timeframes, labels, etc.

## üìã Scripts Overview

The system consists of the following Python scripts located in the `email-agents` directory. While each script can still be run standalone, their functionalities are now also accessible via the main `cli.py` script.

1.  **`cli.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a unified, interactive command-line interface to access all other script functionalities.
    *   **Features:** Presents a menu of options, initializes shared resources (Gmail service, OpenAI client), and calls the appropriate functions in other modules based on user selection.

2.  **`email_utils.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** A utility module providing shared functions for Gmail API authentication (`get_gmail_service` - improved scope handling), sending emails (`send_email`), and terminal color formatting (`TermColors`). Not run directly.

3.  **`email_triage.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Identifies important emails needing a response.
    *   **Features:** Prompts for lookback period (days/hours), analyzes primary inbox emails (optionally including read emails) using AI. Checks against sent emails (lookback period now aligns with incoming scan) to identify previously responded messages.
    *   **Output:** `needs_response_report.md` (Markdown format with detailed statuses), `needs_response_emails.json` (for drafting replies), `all_analyzed_emails.json` (includes all analyzed emails).

4.  **`email_categorize_opportunities.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Scans recent emails to identify and categorize business opportunities.
    *   **Features:** Uses AI for multi-stage classification (sponsorship, inquiry, other) and report generation.
    *   **Output:** `categorized_emails.json`, `opportunity_report.txt`.

5.  **`email_draft_reply.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Assists in drafting replies to emails identified by `email_triage.py`.
    *   **Features:** Reads `needs_response_emails.json`, generates AI draft responses, allows user to review, edit, and send.
    *   **Output:** `response_history.json`.

6.  **`email_plan_cleanup.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Analyzes emails to create a plan for deletion and identify unsubscribe options.
    *   **Features:** Configurable timeframe, AI analysis for deletion candidacy, extracts `List-Unsubscribe` links.
    *   **Output:** `deletion_plan_report.txt`, `deletion_candidates.json`.

7.  **`email_execute_cleanup.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Interactively executes the cleanup plan from `email_plan_cleanup.py`.
    *   **Features:** Prompts user to unsubscribe (mailto/HTTP) and/or delete emails. Colorized terminal output.
    *   **Input:** `deletion_candidates.json`.
    *   **Output:** `cline/action_executor_log.txt`.

8.  **`email_archive_unread.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Helps achieve "Inbox Zero" by archiving all unread inbox emails.
    *   **Features:** Finds all unread emails in the inbox, marks them as read, and moves them to a specified label (default: 'Old Stuff', created if it doesn't exist).
    *   **Note:** Processes emails in batches.

9.  **`email_general_categorizer.py`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Categorizes recent emails into general user-defined categories and applies Gmail labels.
    *   **Features:** Fetches recent emails, uses AI for categorization, creates/applies labels.
    *   **Output:** `categorization_report.txt`, `categorized_emails_general.json`.

10. **`email_manage_filters.py`**:

    *   **Note:** Requires `gmail.settings.basic` and `gmail.labels` scopes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   OpenAI API Key
*   Google Cloud Project with Gmail API enabled:
    *   Follow Google's documentation to create a project, enable the Gmail API, and download `credentials.json` for a "Desktop app" OAuth 2.0 client. Place this file in the `email-agents` directory.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repo_url> # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd email-agents
    ```

2.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Create a `.env` file in the `email-agents` directory with your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

5.  Ensure `credentials.json` (downloaded from Google Cloud Console) is in the `email-agents` directory.

### First Run & Authentication

When you run `cli.py` (or any script that interacts with Gmail) for the first time (or after deleting `token.json`), a browser window will open asking you to log in to your Google account and grant the necessary permissions. After successful authorization, a `token.json` file will be created in the `email-agents` directory. This file stores your access tokens for future runs.

The `cli.py` script requests a comprehensive set of scopes to cover all functionalities. The `email_utils.py` script has been improved to better handle cases where an existing `token.json` might have insufficient scopes, prompting re-authentication when needed.

## üîç Usage Examples

*   **Run the Unified Assistant:**
    ```bash
    python cli.py
    ```
    Follow the on-screen menu and prompts.

*   **Run Individual Scripts (as before):**
    ```bash
    python email_triage.py
    python email_plan_cleanup.py
    # etc.
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

*   **API Keys:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.
*   **Gmail Credentials:** `credentials.json`.
*   **Script-Specific Constants:** Many scripts have constants at the top (e.g., `TARGET_LABEL_NAME` in `email_archive_unread.py`, filter rules in `email_manage_filters.py`) that you can modify to change their behavior.
*   **AI Prompts:** The prompts used for AI analysis are embedded within the respective scripts and can be customized.

## üì° Using Local LLMs for Sensitive Data

The original project included a note about local LLMs. While the current scripts are configured for OpenAI, the principle of modifying the client creation and API calls would still apply if you wish to adapt them for a local LLM. This would involve replacing `client = OpenAI()` and the `client.chat.completions.create(...)` calls with your local LLM's specific SDK.

## üìÅ Output Files

The system generates several output files, typically in the script's directory or a `cline/` subdirectory:

*   `needs_response_report.md` (Markdown triage report)
*   `needs_response_emails.json` (emails flagged for response, used by draft reply script)
*   `all_analyzed_emails.json` (includes all emails analyzed by the triage script)
*   `categorized_emails.json`, `opportunity_report.txt` (from `email_categorize_opportunities.py`)
*   `response_history.json` (from `email_draft_reply.py`)
*   `deletion_plan_report.txt`, `deletion_candidates.json` (from `email_plan_cleanup.py`)
*   `cline/action_executor_log.txt` (from `email_execute_cleanup.py`)
*   `categorization_report.txt`, `categorized_emails_general.json` (from `email_general_categorizer.py`)
*   `token.json` (stores Google API access tokens)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

*   API keys are stored in `.env` (which should be in `.gitignore`).
*   `credentials.json` and `token.json` contain sensitive Google API access information and should also be in `.gitignore` and not committed to public repositories.
*   Be mindful of the permissions (scopes) you grant to the application.
